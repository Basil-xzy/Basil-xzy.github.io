        <h4>THE WHITE HOUSE</h4>
        <h1>UNITED STATE OF WOMEN</h1>
        <p>DOMANI had the immense honor of partnering with BBH LA to design and develop the United State<br> of Women's digital platform.</p><br>
        <p>Convened by the White House, the Summit rallied all of us together to celebrate what we’ve<br> achieved, and how The United State of Women and our allies are going to take action moving forward.</p><br>
    <p>The platform served not only to promote the June 14, 2016 USOW Summit held by the White House,<br> but also to celebrate women, applaud their achievements and support their dreams well beyond the<br> Summit event.</p>    </div>
