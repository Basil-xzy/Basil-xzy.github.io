            <h4>R+CO</h4>
            <h1>ECOMMERCE GETS SEXY</h1>
            <p>R+Co is a fresh new hair brand from a collective of some of the most forward-thinking, rule-bending hairstylists in the business, including Howard McLaren, Garren and Thom Priano. Geared towards salons, the 23-piece collection has rocked the beauty category with unprecedented PR buzz.</p>
            <p>To help launch the brand new line, R+Co tapped DOMANI to create a desktop and mobile commerce experience worthy of the collection’s attitude and style.</p>

            <h3>INSPIRING STYLISTS WITH A FRESH TAKE</h3>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="middle-txt">
        <div class="mt1">
            <p>R+Co needed to announce the brand in a big way, but also needed a design system and ecommerce platform that could accommodate a growing product mix. We wanted the line’s digital presence to communicate with salons and stylists, and so the site needed to be surprising, engaging, and inspirational.</p>
            <p>The new RandCo.com features a playful and avant-garde design that reflects the brand’s creative spirit, yet still acknowledges the practical reality of converting visitors. Instead of simply presenting a set of "digital shelves", we worked to ensure that R+Co’s personality shine through each pixel. The lookbook showcases styling how-to’s with full-bleed images and smooth transitions between the model shots and the products used to create the 'dos. R+Co’s blog - The Collective - celebrates the culture of hairdressing and lets fans easily side-scroll through work from the brains behind the brand.</p>
            <p>R+Co’s launch was covered in countless media outlets like British Vogue, Marie Claire and InStyle, and is currently one of the fastest growing product lines in professional hair care. Key traffic, conversion and revenue metrics have exceeded initial projections - business is booming.</p>
