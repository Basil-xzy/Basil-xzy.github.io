            <h4>MIXING CREATIVITY, EMPATHY, AND TECHNOLOGY CAN CHANGE BEHAVIOR AND IMPROVE THE WAY WE LIVE, WORK, AND PLAY.</h4>
            <p>DOMANI was founded in 2001 with a deep conviction that mixing creativity, technology, and empathy can change behavior and improve the way we live, work, and play. This combination is infused into our approach helping us empower brands large and small to better understand and communicate with - not at - their audiences. We like to be challenged and are driven by unfamiliar opportunities and uncharted territory. Maybe if we didn’t have one of the most progressive creative and technical teams around, or if our process didn’t respond with confidence to the unexpected - maybe then we’d play it safe. But safe is boring, so we’re perfectly happy to embrace the new and design tomorrow, today.</p>
